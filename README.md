# sprint-execution-diagram

## Introduction
This is a tool used by agile teams to retro analyse the execution of a sprint. Every task tackled during that sprint is drawn on how long it took in the different phases.

The sprint is depicted in a Gantt-chart like format based on cycle-time data for every phase.
